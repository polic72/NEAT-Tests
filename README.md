# NEAT-Tests
Testing the NEAT algorithm to solve various problems.

The first test will be to solve Conway's Game of Life.


## Credits
Using the videos from [this youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgomWLYGNl1fcL0o4exBShNeCC5tc6s9C) as an implementation of NEAT. Implementing into C# instead of Java to possibly place this algorithm into [Vita](https://github.com/polic72/Vita).
